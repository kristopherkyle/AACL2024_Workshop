is this working?
yeah it's working... um, c- could i take you back to the to the beginning because you're a a mycologist and you use you know a lot more scientific techniques than some systematic botanists was it the sort of... your interest in science that allowed you to choose mycology or was it because you got interested in mycology that, you developed, you know more scientific, techniques chemical tec- or is that a bad question?
uh, it's, it's not easy to categorize that way um, as an undergraduate i got interested in lichens
mhm
which are, a type of fungal
right
association. and i went to graduate school to do a master's degree on lichens. and before i went to grad- to master's program at Washington, i went on a collecting trip
mhm
in Idaho with, a guy named, Jack Tyler,
mhm
and he was collecting these truffles and false truffles. and for various reasons i went from Washington back to Idaho mostly it had to do with the Vietnam war and,
uhuh
and draft status and the fact that my draft board was in Idaho, and i'd gotten more interested in truffles because, um, everything i found was a new record by several, hundreds of miles
oh okay
or a new species or whatever it was like a big treasure hunt
mhm
and it was pretty exciting because everything was new. so i went back to Idaho and started a PhD with Tyler, well, as part of my alternative service as a conscientious objector, uh i had to do alternative service
mhm
and so i, went to work on uh ecosystems, forest ecosystems project, as a technician, and studied, decomposition, in in the forest. at the same time i was doing my PhD thesis at night and weekends,
uhuh
on a, a systematics monograph.
right
right so i was kinda two parallel
right
tracks that weren't really very related, except that, i was... i guess i've always been interested in ecology
mhm
and i wanted to do more than just put names on things i
right
(xx) to understand that truffles and false truffles and their biology and ecology, and i knew that uh truffles and false truffles were mycorrhizal.
mhm
therefore they were important in forest ecosystems
right
as mycorrhizal fungi and i wanted to know more about that, and i couldn't convince the forest ecosystem people, that that was something they really needed to study. and they eventually told me to go away and get my own grant because there wasn't gonna be enough money to do it, which is what i did.
mhm
so that's what got me into the ecosystems
okay
stuff, was trying to figure out how important these, fungi are that i'm interested
right
in.
because you say several times, uh that they're uh important as food sources for small rodents and
you (often)
and i got into
quite emphasize that people don't realize this very much and
i got interested in thi- this, group of, of fungi because they have two important symbioses one is this one with trees for the nutrition,
mhm
and the second is with animals for spore dispersal
right
which means they have real bottlenecks when it comes to being, dispersed
mhm
and re-establishing new,
right
new colonies or whatever. and so that makes them intriguing.
okay
so i guess i don't yeah i
that's very
helpful
wasn't satisfied just to put names on things.
right oh oh yeah that's going to come up again a a a bit later um... right up to date now, uh Bob Shaeffer's retired. you're left as the single curator of of fungi. is that gonna affect what you do very much or
is that?
yeah it means i have less time to be as, diverse as i have been
uhuh
and i have had- starting to shed, some kinds of research, because i just don't have time, and
that's
because of the curatorial uh thing and that r- right? okay
so i'm star- and because... my mission i guess is better defined with the herbarium rather than an_ as a as- associate curator.
mhm
where i had m- minimal curatorial
oh yeah
responsibility i could interpret my, research a lot broader, than i could, you know (couldn't) now.
so automatically even whether Bob was still here as a as a curator you, you hafta, you know
well
work with Rich or whatever it is and
(xx) or the technician?
(a lot) with the technician yeah.
yeah
and... the other, part of that is is that, i've gotten into a rather large project and it's starting to, it's, scary i'm not sure i'm gonna get it finished and uh, that means i'm gonna have to shed some stuff
right
in order to finish that project.
there's a new hire coming who's sort of w- working on the molecular level
yeah
on vascular plants who's gonna have
i'm hoping to
that
parasitize him yeah
oh right.
i mean this is_ there's another person with your kind of experimental
yeah
right? bench sort of interests technical interests right. so that's gonna?
different, different problem
right
different group of organisms but, some of the techniques are the same.
oh okay...
i think what we'll find with him is that he won't have time to (do) curator.
mhm. is that, reasonable for a hotshot assistant professor to say you know you can, don't worry about that too much, at this stage?
yeah
i mean it would strike me as being reasonable it's like
yeah
it's
taking administrative jobs in you know
yeah that's what basically, how w- how it's treated.
yeah... yeah, um, you've got a lot of publications but,
unlike some people you don't do much editing? has that been a matter of policy or have i
misread
you mean edit- editing of other people's stuff?
right yeah, you know, on
i c- i don't think
journals or edited books you work with this guy Anderson a lot and he seems to do a whole stack of it right? this David
Anderson?
uh
Aberdeen?
David Atkinson
Atkinson rather
uh i don't consider myself a good writer
uhuh, alright. and that's why you you know you know
plus it, it requires more time than (i)
yeah i just wondered i mean
(you know)
i do i do a lot of editing in the sense that i do a lot of grant proposal reviewing,
mhm
and that kind of thing
right. okay. but is that editing or is that, reviewing? i mean is this
it's reviewing, yeah.
so you get the final product and say you say yes or no, you're not somebody knocks on your door and say, you know, could you read through this and, okay. alright.
also i'm in a very esoteric field.
uhuh
in some respects
right
there isn't a body of people. although i just reviewed a manuscript for a woman at Berkeley.
uhuh... if you you look at the publication record it there s- sort of seems to be quite a clear trend. it seems to me that if when you're working on on systematics, right? uh of of fungi you tend to write on your own, or sometimes with one other person. when you do a lot of the sort of fungal ecology, you seem to join up with you know another person and there's a couple of others like, some, some paper on elevated atmospheric C-O-two and feedback, a kind of a big interdisciplinary thing where you join up with a with a
i think that's
group would that be fair assum-
fair guess?
yeah, that's that's a, a function of the disciplines.
mhm
systematics tends to be uh, systematics to me tends to be a... kind of a solitary occupation.
mhm
cuz i consider it to be
it's kinda like solving a prob- a puzzle.
uhuh
whereas the ecosystem stuff is done in collaboration with people because, no one person probably holds enough information to,
right
realize all the ramifications
yeah
so you typically work, the other thing is that in order for me to, stay involved in some of the ecosystems stuff, i've, the only way i can do that,
mhm
is to collaborate. in other words i don't think i'll ever write another proposal,
uhuh
as a P-I in ecosystems.
uhuh
i i'll collaborate as a co-P-I but i don't think i'll ever
write (another.)
right, is that because you now feel that your major contribution to this is i- i- is knowing the organisms i mean is n- the background or i- or, or has the sort of ecosystem world moved on to more kind of you know high-powered mathematical modeling or whatever else
(xx?)
no we have a proposal right now.
uhuh
and we just submitted another one, and i_ as a collaborator.
right
um
i've always felt that i have ideas,
yeah
and my problem is not coming up with ideas my t- problem is usually finding enough time to do something
about the ideas
yeah well, that's right
and so my contribution like on the recent proposal we got funded was_ is mainly as a, to provide the framework and the ideas
uhuh
and the other person, executes writes the proposal,
yeah
and executes the, the research with some input from me as to you know what's going wrong and what needs to be done.
when i when i look through, it seems to me that the kind of the systematic stuff, over your career seems to go in certain kind of bursts. and now this may be just be because there there there're delays and timelags in publications but there's sort of some stuff in sixty-six sixty-seven there's a couple of papers in eighty-five, there's some papers,
yeah
five or six years ago and there's a couple of recent ones. i wondered whether that whether i was right about that or whether
this is?
yeah that's probably right. it uh has to do with what i'm involved in a big p-
yeah that's right, that's what i was gonna say. there's a (if) there's a big project that's uh, taking your time away somewhat
and i have
several
that's what you fall back on in some way, well not really fall back on but that's the sort of steady state and then you get these peaks of other major
project activity
yeah but, i have a couple big things going on in taxonomy that i've been working on for,
mhm
i hate to say it decades
now i just haven't f-
yeah well
you're not the only one around here who's been working on these things for
(decades)
(just) haven't finished yet.
yeah. you know i do some sort of uh, quite serious birdwatching, and the ornithologists you know tend to be uh kind of lumpers or splitters i mean they wanna divide species or (xx) but, it seemed to me if i looked at for example your two n- papers in uh, nineteen eighty-five in one case you're setting up a new genus on the other case you're saying these six species are actually all one. so you don't have any predisposition to_ i mean cuz ornithologists seem to have a predisposition is to go one way or the other it all depends on the evidence
well, the group that i work in is so badly known,
uhuh
that, you're gonna i've got, n- i have a new genus right now,
uhuh
that i am working on that i'm gonna describe. but it's taken me, three weeks to figure out, that, to feel comfortable with the fact that it is a new genus my basic philosophy, and, part of what's, what the interaction is with the ecosystem in order to ask some ecosystem's or ecology-type questions you have to be able to put names on the organisms.
mhm
the taxonomy of my group is so bad that you can't put names on organisms therefore you're forced to, to do systematics,
is the taxonomy?
in one in one sense. and and what that means is that, i, tend to favor, a systematics that, is practical
mhm
and it works. and if you've got a large number of species that are distinguished by what i consider poor characters,
mhm
and that one paper you're talking about was, i used statistical analysis,
mhm
to resolve that problem,
right
um, then i'll lump them.
yeah
on the other hand if i think something is, is distinctive then i'll go ahead and describe it... but the idea is is that, people other than me should be able to sit down and put a name on something
right
for whatever reason that they need a name.
now th- the guys down the corridor who do deal with vascular plants and th- they develop their keys and and and so on. these are sort of usable, in the field right? because, while in your case you're often dealing with microns rather than millimeters and you hafta bring 'em back and put 'em
well the
under big microscopes and?
i can identify things t- to genus in the field
uhuh
okay. now how i do that sometimes i'm not sure
right
but i would guess my accuracy is, ninety percent,
mhm
but to put species names on things requires, uh examination of the spores
right
and so it's not practical
right
for me to try to identify things in the
right right
field. i could probably give you a good guess, but,
yeah
i'd be wrong a lotta the time too.
yeah right... right what is Kelly and Judd? color names?
it's a standard.
just a color chart? a stamp collector's chart?
there are various competing color charts.
alright. um, going back to your, Destuntzia paper, remember that one?
yeah
nineteen eighty-five ? well on of the, because it was a a new genus and you found had three new species and so on, i'd like to talk to you a little bit about, how you come up with the names?
okay
Destuntzia himself in honor of professor Daniel E Stu- Stuntz or
right
whatever. who was?
he was the mycologist at the University of Montana, who my major professor, Jack Tyler
uhuh
my PhD professor, was a st- well was a, quote student of his,
mhm
this involved lineage but, uh worked with Doctor Stuntz, and Tyler's the one that wanted to name it Destuntzia
okay
because what happened in that case is i picked up several things that i decided were new and different and Tyler had already decided the one thing that he had,
uhuh
was new and different and, since i had the greater bulk of the material we decided to, uh that i would go ahead and write the paper up but he insisted that it be named after this Stuntz, my personal preference would not be to name it after somebody,
uhuh
and especially in that at that time Stuntz was alive, and i would be very reluctant to name it after somebody else living.
(well okay) so what's a Stuntz foray?
that is a, gathering of mycologists and students from various institutions uh, at a what's it called oh Boy Scout camp
mhm
or some other place in the woods typically where
uhuh
it's a center for collecting over a weekend and, putting names on things and exchanging information
right. that sounds good. is Harkness a hero of yours?
um
one or two bits in this paper about Harkness eight_ eighteen ninety-nine and, suggesting you know that maybe he got it right and later people were perhaps quite not got it right i mean
well i've really never thought of him as a hero i di-
well perhaps hero is a sort of jokey term but i mean a
well, i thought it was amazing that he did what he did
yeah
given the time and state of things.
right
(Gilke) is another one that i feel, never received the recognition in her lifetime that she should've received.
uhuh
do people name things after Harkness?
yeah
i mean Harknissiae? do you get those?
yeah Harknessiae.
(xx...) and the Latin names that you choose?
they
(xx) it usually has to do with some distinctive what i think is something distinctive about the species, like So- Sax Montana Rocky Mountains.
right.
i don't like color, terms for species names, (crescia) rubens and stuff that
uhuh
(Smith) used... partly cuz i don't like color as a character
uhuh
which i shouldn't admit but i'm partially color-blind
uhuh...
well that's, that actually is,
cuz there's a little sentence in one of your methodologies that's a little strange, and uh that might that might actually explain that
oh actually that's brilliant. okay i'll write that up, (and you can tell me about it.) and you named one of them the last one for Herb Saylor?
yeah, he's an amateur
that's what i
who has a very good knowledge of, hypogeous fungi and has spent a lotta time collecting things and was never able to realize his ambition to become a mycologist,
mhm
because he, because of family situations and because he could make more money as an engineer working for the Caterpillar corporation.
mhm, hm', alright. okay. where is East
East
it's in Kent.
okay, i ought to know that. i've now moved on to the uh, you know the Soil Biotron
right
thing
was that your term ?
Biotron was the, the name that's in the literature for similar facilities is Rhizotron.
right, that that's an older name right?
right and we chose Biotron, because we felt it reflected, the interaction the biology of below ground rather than just the focus on roots...
the one that's up at the biological station and the one at East Ma- Malling, these're the two main ones?
no there there're a bunch
uhuh
now
now is there, this is all sort of
well
the last decade or what?
i should give you a paper
okay
i'll give you a paper,
right
the there're at least two major different types
mhm
and there're ones that are used as lysimeters to study, physical processes in soils like the effect of fertilization and water movement, and then there are ones that are designed to look at biology.
mhm
and there're far fewer ones to study biology than there are ones to study physical factors .
oh okay
John Tanner wrote a paper,
uhuh
something on inventive minds, trying to figure out where i was coming from on the Biotron (xx)
oh okay. you have a copy of that or
should i?
yeah i have a copy
of that
oh okay
i may have to xerox it but i have one
one of the papers that you have that's one of the co- coauthored papers this is the New Dawn paper? do you know where this metaphor of the New Dawn came from was that you or some or one of the others or?
gee i don't really know.
it d- doesn't matter. just wondered whether
i have a terrible memory
when you're the second author of a paper that the_ this means that... you're not the primary writer right but you co-author it or you
argue about it?
well, in my associations, it doesn't matter who did the research whoever writes the paper, is the first author
right
and then the other author assignments are based on the degree of contribution.
right. but when you say that the first author writes the paper
yeah that's what they do
but, second and third authors get to comment on it and discuss it and modify it and argue about it
right
and the usual thing
(a co-)
but the one who actually
right
sits down and physically writes
right
it gets to be first author.
right. for a person who says that he doesn't think he's a very good writer, in fact looking at the record there's lots of stuff you've written of your own and there's quite a lot of co-authored stuff where you obviously were the primary writer. right?
yeah if i'm first author yeah
so... y- perhaps you feel that this is a, a general comment of your field or you
no i
or you're average or you know?
no i'm not i'm below average. i think i write like a German.
mhm
i have
too many
that's not a bad thing in science
necessarily
well i have too many dependent clauses
uhuh
and uh, my logic is hard for people to follow i think. i've been told that actually.
oh well i'll i'll remember that, you wait till you see my writing.
could i take you on to um, one of your, latest papers. this is the Materials for the
Hypogeous
Hypogeous i'm glad you pronounced that first, uh Mycoflora. um it's it's clear i think that, that fr- from what you said right at the beginning and and from my own reading is that for you a a a flora is something rather more than what say Bill might think of it as being. that
it's more than a list of species yeah.
it's not a re- just a regional inventory you wanna know, not only you know where they are and how many they are but but why and how they got there.
right.
um, does that mean that... you're more depende- i mean if if you were going to write, a Hypogeous
i am writing
Mycoflora for the Great Basin right?
i'm i am writing it yeah
i mean how many genera are there and how many species and how long is it going to take you and how much, is known and?
well i'm guessing that there's, i i could count (but) i probably have thirty-five or forty genera and probably a hundred species
mhm
be my guess right now.
right, and how many of them have you tackled in some, preliminary way ?
most of them.
most of them.
(that's) they're sitting right there
right. but, but then if you look at at that that article, that Materials (for) there's actually for you a very long introduction.
uh before we get to the taxonomic treatment
right
where you're talking a great deal a- about m-
mechanisms
mechanisms... so you know your account, your final account is gonna, hafta deal with all these forest islands and how they
yeah wh-
(are) in some and not in others and
the way i envision the book it will have chapters on uh, what are the hypogeous fungi?
right
something about their biology and ecology, it will have, a discussion of the Great Basin,
mhm
and its history,
right
and uh then uh some uh discussion of the biogeography of the truffles in relation to their hosts.
right
so what you're star- what you see in the papers that've been published are some preliminary attempts to, uh grapple with some of those issues.
s- so i would be right in thinking
that
and some of those are in conflict with, some thinking about, the way speciation occurs.
right. i mean it would be my guess that... taking that kind of approach, makes you a little bit more dependent on sort of general advances in biology and ecology than say Bill in the Flora where he can,
well you
(with what with before) they can just go go ahead as it were
there're two reasons that i selected the Great Basin,
uhuh
okay one is it had never been collected
right
in fact i tried, i think it was eighty-two, to get funded to collect that and i couldn't get funding from the National Science Foundation cuz they said, the probability of su- su- success was low even though i had good circumstantial evidence that,
mhm
things occurred there because no one had ever collected anything
there.
was it too xeric that would be the reason?
it just hadn't been collected.
mhm
and they and they thought there were, too few forests,
yeah
to to make it worth my time and i would spend too much time with little result.
mhm
the other reason i chose it was because the, uh the fact that through the analysis of packrat middens,
mhm
(they've) been able to work out the paleohistory for the last ten thousand years in such great detail about vegetation
okay
and all that stuff, which is, you're right it sets the general background that i can ask f- some, well ask? yeah ask some interesting questions about, where the truffles are and how they got there and whether they're actually evolving or just going extinct. and so, yeah there were a couple reasons i chose the the Great Basin as a
okay
as a place to work.
alright... i think i'm getting pretty well to um towards the end uh... s- some years ago quite some years ago now i came to talk to you and borrow your your reprint requests and you were telling me at that time that you often did, often ordered something like three hundred copies of uh offprints especially in the, ecology kind of area
right
and and i you know i notice that those seventy-seven papers are still cited in the Science Citation Index
yeah i haven't looked for a while
to this day or whatever
i was there with my graduate assistant this morning looking you up, uh
you'll see a big difference in the way they're cited.
uhuh. well i didn't... would you like to tell me about that because uh, i mean cuz i didn't look at the actual papers i just looked
at the
well systematists don't tend to cite other
oh no i know that, that's become very clear
yeah, they don't cite papers
no they're all hidden away in the notes.
well they're yeah they're hidden away in the, in the species descriptions.
yes that's right, yeah. quite strange actually.
yeah it is because it makes us look bad.
yeah you never you never look as though
anybody but they're doing some of your work is of course you know you're more cited than anybody else in the building i suspect huh?
yeah on the ecology stuff.
yeah
and part of that is a function of getting a paper picked up in a review.
right.
and methods papers tend to get
yeah
cited more.
yeah. although i notice that there are some citations for the sort of the Soil Biotron series of papers you you hoping that's gonna take off in some other kinda way or?
uh, i basically consider myself done on the si- Soil Biotron.
is this as a result of having this major project out in the field
yeah
in the in the Great basin or is it a, uh a kind of you know lack of interest in general?
it's not a lack of interest it's a lack of time.
yeah
between the curation and the
yeah
i should, i don't know if i should say this, the director requested that i, the the way he put it was, several years ago was that he prefer that i not do any more root research.
they wanted other people to do root research in there?
no they felt that it w- didn't fit the mission of the herbarium.
oh okay. oh that director not the director of the biological station.
no this director
alright, yeah,
yeah and i've
no but well
i mean
i tended to i've tended to ignore it but
but you could see i mean i'm an outsider but i don't know the field
no i
but you could see it's not, it's it's a p- it's a possible position to to take.
well the other thing about, some of that stuff is it's gotten away from, having a direct feedback into the, my interests in ecology and biology of the
right right
false truffles. it's gotten... kind of,
yeah
off the off the path.
right.
but i still have an interest in it and that's the
right
reason why i'm collaborating, with, with Lussenhop.
you used to get all these reprint requests they've all disappeared because of email and the rest of it?
most people xerox stuff now i get
yeah
stuff from overseas but
but just
but just the odd thing
just the Chinese or whatever else?
yeah and especially now that i'm not publishing in mycorrhizae. it's
ahah
pretty well dried up.
you cope with page charges and all those stuff and all those
things?
yeah i've been lucky in that i've managed to stay funded.
yeah...
i've had, the Great Basin project's is in its second three year funding from the National Science Foundation so , and they they're the ones that have told me not to go on a for a third, grant because they want to see a, book.
it'll be a book?
if i get it done yeah
yeah
it's scaring me right now.
okay well that's all i have to ask you, for the moment.
okay, good.
